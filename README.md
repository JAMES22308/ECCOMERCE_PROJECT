## üìã Description

This is a **CLI-based eCommerce system** written in Python, supporting two types of users:

- **Admin**:
  - Can perform full **CRUD** operations on products.
  - Can **update the status** of user orders (`Processing`, `Shipped`, `Cancelled`, `Failed`, `Delivered`).
  - Can **register only once** to avoid multiple admin accounts.

- **User**:
  - Can register multiple accounts.
  - Can view product listings, view cart and place orders.
  - Can cancel orders. (still working on it)
  - Has a **displayed balance** in the system (virtual money). (still working on it)
  - Receives error messages for invalid actions (e.g. wrong credentials, ordering more than available stock).
